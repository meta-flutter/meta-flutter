SUMMARY = "A light-weight Flutter Engine Embedder for Raspberry Pi that runs without X."
DESCRIPTION = "A light-weight Flutter Engine Embedder for Raspberry Pi. Inspired by \
               https://github.com/chinmaygarde/flutter_from_scratch. Flutter-pi also \
               runs without X11, so you don't need to boot into Raspbian Desktop & \
               have X11 and LXDE load up; just boot into the command-line."
