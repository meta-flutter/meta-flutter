1. Offline build support. If you have already ran do_archive_pub_cache on a flutter recipe, you can now build it without a network connection.

  Note: if you have pub-cache archive files populated in the DL_DIR it will skip the network fetch.

2. remove all ${AUTOREV} references.
3. remove do_compile[network] = "1" from flutter-app template.
* requires app recipes to add as needed.
4. set pub cache offline after a flutter clean.
5. flutter-sdk-native
  - remove deletion of ${S}/bin/cache/pkg/sky_engine/ and ${S}/bin/cache/artifacts/*
    most likely will require update for SDK
  - update to append to do_unpack
6. flutter-app template do_cleanall will remove pub cache archive from DL_DIR
7. create the app pub-cache from the flutter-sdk pub-cache
8. remove unused var FLUTTER_PUB_CMD

4. Move --obfuscate to a variable that can be overriden
5. 3.16.5

Nov 9, 2023
1. Replace pyyaml use with re to avoid mixing host and Yocto -native
   Python bits.
2. Changed a couple of pubspec.yaml name errors to bb.fatal to stop
   build immediately, as do_compile will fail.

Nov 8, 2023
1. Update engine_sdk.zip contents to enable impeller 3d aot generation from host
2. Support unpotimized builds with IsCreationCurrentThreadCurrent patch
  https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/129533
  https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/135345

Nov 6, 2023
1. Use pyyaml from Yocto build not from system

Nov 4, 2023
1. Dart AOT plugin registration is working in all tested cases.
  This is confirmed on 3.13.9 using the --source flag during
  kernel snapshot creation.  The scenario where some apps were 
  correctly calling _PluginRegistrant.register and not others,
  was resolved by setting the --obfuscate flag for the gen_snapshot
  invocation.  This is now enabled by default for release/profile builds.

Nov 2, 2023
1. Includes dart_plugin_registrant.dart file in AOT
  https://github.com/meta-flutter/meta-flutter/issues/115
2. filter dart_plugin_registrant.dart against unused platforms.
3. path_provider is dependent on xdg-user-dirs if you want official xdg directories,
  otherwise methods return home path.  For apps that are dependent on xdg-user-dirs
  add xdg-user-dirs to your RDEPENDS, and run `xdg-user-dirs-update`
  on birthday boot from user that runs homescreen/flutter-auto.
4. ivi-homescreen/flutter-auto known working apps included in meta-flutter:
  * flutter_markdown_example
  * google_maps_flutter_example
    runs - not plumbed into proprietary module
  * path_provider_example
    run xdg-user-dirs-update same user as the homescreen/flutter-auto runs as
  * animated_background_example
  * gallery
  * go_router_examples
  * google_sign_in_example
  * extension_google_sign_in_example
  * shared_preferences_example
  * file_selector_example
    runs, and zenity starts
    works on desktop homescreen/flutter-auto
    For AGL app activation code needed
  * url_launcher_example
    url launch works, webview launch/close not wired in
    For AGL app activation code needed
  * camera_example
    runs, does not talk to flutter-auto
  * wonders
    does not display anything
    shared_preference plugin issue - needs investigation
    appears to be pigeon related
  * in_app_purchase_example
    does not display anything
    appears to be pigeon related 
  * video_player_example
    runs, does not talk to homescreen/flutter-auto.  Needs update to work with pigeon
  

March 17, 2023
* APP_GEN_SNAPSHOT_FLAGS - allows setting gen_snapshot flags like `--no-use-integer-division`
* FLUTTER_APP_RUNTIME_MODES - allows setting runtime mode per app.  Deprecates use of FLUTTER_APP_SKIP_DEBUG_INSTALL.
* APP_AOT_EXTRA_DART_DEFINES - allows setting Dart defines for AOT builds
* Local version patch override. allows overriding patch set applied.  Could also be in bbappend.

March 5, 2023
* 3.7.6 support introduced
* Toyota OSS 0223
* local resolution of Flutter SDK and Engine Versions - LTS

Dec 26, 2022

* dart-sdk added - building/linking with the Yocto Clang toolchain.
* Package Groups added - flutter-agl-apps, flutter-test-apps
* Container Image added - app-container-image, app-container-image-flutter-auto
* Breaking Changes

  Removed BBCLASS implementation for -runtimedebug, -runtimeprofile, -runtimerelease
  Removed FLUTTER_RUNTIME
  Flutter Engine runtime variants are now built based on PACKAGECONFIG values: debug, profile, release, jit_release.  The default is release.
  To add additional runtime variants in addition to `release` use this pattern in local.conf:
      `PACKAGECONFIG:append:pn-flutter-engine = " profile debug"`
  flutter-app.bbclass installs app for each engine build available in the target sysroot.
  By default Flutter Apps are not installed for runtime=debug.  This can be overriden in local.conf using `FLUTTER_APP_SKIP_DEBUG_INSTALL = "false"`.

* Breaking Change
  
  Suffix for flutter runtime types has been changed to better define it.  Less confusing. 

  -runtimerelease (was -release)
  -runtimeprofile (was -profile)
  -runtimedebug (was -debug)

* FLUTTER_CHANNEL support has been deprecated

* FLUTTER_SDK_TAG - New approach.  Allows locking SDK and Engine to specific commit hash.
  Valid values for FLUTTER_SDK_TAG are here:  https://github.com/flutter/flutter/tags
  
* Flutter Engine Commit
  The Flutter Engine Commit is based on the value of `FLUTTER_SDK_TAG.`
  The default value of `FLUTTER_SDK_TAG` is set in `conf/include/flutter-version.inc`.  If `FLUTTER_SDK_TAG` is overriden with `"AUTOINC"` in local.conf, stable channel is used for the engine commit.

* build failure due to gn unknown parameter for `--no-build-embedder-examples`.  One solution to resolve this is to exclude `disable-embedder-examples` from PACKAGECONFIG in local.conf using:

  ```
  PACKAGECONFIG:pn-flutter-engine-runtimerelease = "disable-desktop-embeddings embedder-for-target fontconfig release"
  PACKAGECONFIG:pn-flutter-engine-runtimedebug = "disable-desktop-embeddings embedder-for-target fontconfig debug"
  PACKAGECONFIG:pn-flutter-engine-runtimeprofile = "disable-desktop-embeddings embedder-for-target fontconfig profile"
   ```
  This issue is related to missing gn options `--build-embedder-examples` and `--no-build-embedder-examples` from certain builds.  I have `disable-embedder-examples` defined in PACKAGECONFIG by default, so if you have an engine commit that is missing this option, you need to use the PACKAGECONFIG sequence above.  Once the gn option rolls into all channels this override will no longer be needed.
